# Digital Signage Configurator for ARM devices
Auto configuration tools for deploying raspberry pis to be used as digital signage systems.
Feel free to use my work anyway you like. Be sure you link back to me & ukscone as this repo 
utilizes his overscan tool.
# Operating Systems
Currently only support for 
## Arch Linux ARM
## Raspbian

# Notes about Rise Vision
It is not officially supported on anything other than Raspbian (sadly).
It did work May 2018 - July 25 2018, and perhaps worked before then as well.
When installing rise on alarm, it either locks up the computer, or throws some bogus error streams
when trying to load the app (even though it installed sucessfully!)

The install scripts can easily be modified to support your setup. I personally prefer kweb and omxplayergui, but my coworkers really like rise..
